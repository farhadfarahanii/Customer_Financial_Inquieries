# Financial Customer Inquiries Project


### Problem Statement

Banks struggle with handling and categorizing customer inquiries efficiently, leading to delays, misrouting, and increased operational costs. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning-based system to automatically classify customer inquiries into predefined categories (e.g., Billing, Account Access, Fraud, Loan Services, etc.) based on text analysis of customer interactions.

This system will leverage SBERT embeddings and clustering (DBSCAN) for topic discovery, followed by classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost, etc.) to accurately categorize new inquiries. The expected outcome is a system that reduces manual effort, improves response times, and enhances customer satisfaction.

### Background

Banks receive thousands of customer inquiries daily through various channels such as call centers, chatbots, and emails. These inquiries cover a range of topics, including account issues, transactions, credit cards, fraud, and technical support. Manually sorting and responding to these inquiries takes time, increases operational costs, and affects customer satisfaction.

To improve efficiency, automated classification of customer inquiries using machine learning and NLP (Natural Language Processing) can help route queries to the right department and provide faster responses.
